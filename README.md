# bouncy-balls

Tool which estimates the height of the first bounce of a ball,
created originally to find the glass transition temperature of a rubber ball.

The script takes a volume sample of a single bounce.
Once the ball is dropped, the times of subsequent bounces
are used to calculate the height of the first bounce.

This tool was written for GNU Octave, Matlab compatibility is untested.
